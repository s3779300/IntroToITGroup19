<p>Ever since I was a little kid, I have been interested in video games and computers. I enjoy seeing how things work and how they interact with each other. 
    I currently have a little experience coding or anything software based, but I have built my own computer multiple times.
</p>

<p>I’m not too sure what my ideal job is currently, I was hoping to get a better understanding or find what I enjoy doing by doing this course. 
    I have found an interest in Artificial Intelligence and wish to explore where that will take me.
